Integrated electronic circuit design and simulation solutions in E-XD++ visualization component library is an important solution, E-XD++ Visualization Graphics is a 100% Visual C++ / MFC  based Vector Editor, it ships with complete source codes,  it contains the most popular electronic circuit design, editing capabilities features. From the first version of E-XD++, it already has the full features on circuit network diagram Design, the current version of E-XD++ has performed its functions to extreme, basically, if you want to build any very professional  Multisim NI Schematic like circuit design and simulation  or Other real time graphics based applications,  E-XD++ will be the best choice. It has almost all the features of a very professional circuit design software. It supports SVG Importing and Exporting. DXF Importing and Exporting, XML Loading and Sving, many kinds of electronic circuit symbols. The VBScript & JavaScript is used for action controlling of any shapes on the canvas.  It will be the best choice for building your own "Full Customized" Industry software, you do not event need to write one line of code, a very professional and complete functional Multisim like application is created, it will saves you at least 80% of building time and a lot of money.
